Spark Trak is a professional collaboration application leveraging Cisco Spark to provide secure communication.

Intended to be used by health care professionals, laywers, insurance agents, etc - any professional that needs
to share information pertaining to a client.

By entering into Spark Room, the professionals are able to discuss and access confidential records.  While in 
the Spark Room, they are able to initiate actions relevant to the client - order procedures, prescribe 
medication, set appointments.  

Upon exiting the Spark room, the collaboration session is archived and can generate a billing record for the client.





This chat example showcases how to use `socket.io` with a static `express` server.

## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.
